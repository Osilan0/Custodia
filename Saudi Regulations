Saudi Regulations


LoRa Communication Regulations in Saudi Arabia:

Using LoRa on the ISM bands does not require an individual spectrum license (no fee or frequency assignment needed) as long as devices meet the technical specs. However, a service license is required if providing IoT connectivity as a service to third parties. CST’s IoT regulations state that deploying license-exempt LPWAN networks for others (commercial use) is subject to obtaining an IoT service provider license

It means It is permitted to operate private LoRa networks without a license if they are used internally and typically within a closed area. The equipment must be type-approved and installed by the property owner. For outdoor or public, LoRaWAN deployments require a CST license.


Satellite Communication & Spectrum Rules

Operators must obtain registration or network licenses from CST to provide service in KSA; end‑user terminals do not require separate licenses if they are provided through licensed operators

Use of satellite uplinks involves designated licensed spectrum held by the satellite provider which means our devices must be CST type‑approved and the provider must be registered in KSA.

All telecom/IT devices must be type‑approved by CST before import or deployment; labeling and local or accredited testing are required

Devices defined as IoT must obtain a CST certificate; user manuals must explain connectivity limitations; manufacturers must educate users about security; foreign SIMs allowed for a max of 120 days before replacing with local SIMs

Use of IPv6 is recommended; CST may require periodic reports from IoT providers; all systems must adhere to national data, security, privacy rules



Data Processing, Storage & Localization
All servers used in providing IoT services, and all data, be hosted inside the Kingdom

Public sector entity data must remain within Saudi territory, no transfer abroad including for caching/backups, unless specifically allowed and approved by CST and the customer

CST may require service providers to monitor, log, and provide data logs on demand to authorities; service providers must implement risk management, business continuity, and secure user protection mechanisms

Implementing Regulations mandate rules for protecting user data, preserving confidentiality, and classifying information; service providers bear responsibility for confidentiality of communications

CST can request logs from IoT service providers; expect data retention for minimum periods (12 months recommended) for regulatory inspection; logs must remain within national jurisdiction; service providers responsible for record-keeping accuracy.
